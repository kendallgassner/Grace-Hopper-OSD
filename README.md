# Scenario


Kendall just started a new job as a developer. For her first task she was asked to make a pull request in her teams 'About me' repo. This repo was created for new team members to share a little snippet about themselves and get to know other team members. Kendall has decided to share her interest in dogs. She has a pointer lab mix named Luna and loves to spend time taking Luna on walks and to the dog beach. 

Kendall's made her pull request not considering that some of her coworkers might be using assitive technology. For this workshop you will be helping Kendall fix her pull request so all of her coworkers can get to know who Kendall is.
